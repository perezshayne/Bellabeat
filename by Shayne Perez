## 3. PREPARE PHASE

**3.1 Data Source**

The dataset used for this capstone project is the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data. This dataset is generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016 - 05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.

## 4. PROCESS PHASE

**4.1 Installing and Loading the packages**

First, we install the tidyverse packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # metapackage of all tidyverse packages
```

**4.2 Importing Datasets**

FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius): This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits. 

Import the zip folder containing the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data.

**4.3 Renaming the Datasets**

```{r}
activity <-read.csv("/kaggle/input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyActivity_merged.csv")
calories <-read.csv("/kaggle/input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyCalories_merged.csv")
intensities <-read.csv("/kaggle/input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyIntensities_merged.csv")
intensitiesh <-read.csv("/kaggle/input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/hourlyIntensities_merged.csv")
dailysteps <-read.csv("/kaggle/input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailySteps_merged.csv")
hourlysteps <-read.csv("/kaggle/input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/hourlySteps_merged.csv")
sleep <-read.csv("/kaggle/input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/sleepDay_merged.csv")
sleepDay <-read.csv("/kaggle/input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/sleepDay_merged.csv")
minutes_sleep <-read.csv("/kaggle/input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/minuteSleep_merged.csv")
weight <-("/kaggle/input/fitbit/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
```

**4.4 Viewing the Datasets**

```{r}
head(activity)
```

**4.5 Formatting and Separating of Date and Time**

```{r}
activity$ActivityDate=as.POSIXct(activity$ActivityDate, format="%m/%d/%Y", tz=Sys.timezone())
activity$date <- format(activity$ActivityDate, format = "%m/%d/%y")

sleep$SleepDay=as.POSIXct(sleep$SleepDay, format="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p", tz=Sys.timezone())
sleep$date <- format(sleep$SleepDay, format = "%m/%d/%y")

intensitiesh$ActivityHour=as.POSIXct(intensitiesh$ActivityHour, format="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p", tz=Sys.timezone())
intensitiesh$time <- format(intensitiesh$ActivityHour, format = "%H:%M:%S")
intensitiesh$date <- format(intensitiesh$ActivityHour, format = "%m/%d/%y")

hourlysteps$ActivityHour=as.POSIXct(hourlysteps$ActivityHour, format="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p", tz=Sys.timezone())
hourlysteps$time <- format(hourlysteps$ActivityHour, format = "%H:%M:%S")
hourlysteps$date <- format(hourlysteps$ActivityHour, format = "%m/%d/%y")

```

## 5. ANALYZE PHASE
**5.1 Summarizing of Data**

```{r}
n_distinct(activity$Id)
n_distinct(calories$Id)
n_distinct(intensities$Id)
n_distinct(dailysteps$Id)
n_distinct(hourlysteps$Id)
n_distinct(intensitiesh$Id)
n_distinct(sleep$Id)
```

This information tells us about number participants in each data sets.
**There are 33 participants in the activity, calories, daily and hourly intensities, daily and hourly steps data sets, 24 in the sleep.**

```{r}
# Summary of Activity
activity %>%  
select(TotalSteps,
TotalDistance,
SedentaryMinutes, Calories) %>%
summary()

activity %>%
select(VeryActiveMinutes, FairlyActiveMinutes, LightlyActiveMinutes, SedentaryMinutes) %>%
summary()

# Summary of Calories
calories %>%
select(Calories) %>%
summary()

# Summary of Daily Steps
dailysteps %>%
select(StepTotal) %>%
summary()

# Summary of Sleep 
sleep %>%
select(TotalSleepRecords, TotalMinutesAsleep, TotalTimeInBed) %>%
summary()

```

**5.2 Findings from the Summary**

* The Average Total Steps is 7638 steps. 
* The Sedentary Minutes is 991.2 minutes which is equivalent to 16.52 hours. While the Total Time in Bed is 458.6 minutes which is 7.64 hours.
* Comparing the activities, we can see that most of the participants are lightly active.
* The Average Minutes of Sleep is 419.5 minutes that is equivalent to 7 hours. 

**5.3 Merging of Data**

```{r}
sleepactivity_merged <- merge(sleep, activity, by=c('Id', 'date'))

head(sleepactivity_merged)
```


## 6. SHARE PHASE

**6.1 Total Steps vs. Calories**
```{r}
ggplot(data=activity, aes(x=TotalSteps, y=Calories, color='pink')) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + labs(title="Total Steps vs. Calories")
```

**There is a positive correlation between the Total Steps and Calories. The more steps we take, the more calories we burn.**



**6.2 Average Total Intensity vs. Time**
```{r}
int_new <- intensitiesh %>%
  group_by(time) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  summarise(mean_total_int = mean(TotalIntensity))

ggplot(data=int_new, aes(x=time, y=mean_total_int)) + geom_histogram(stat = "identity", fill='pink') +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) +
  labs(title="Average Total Intensity vs. Time")
```

**People are most active between 5:00pm to 7:00pm**



**6.3Average Total Steps vs. Time**
```{r}
steps_new <- hourlysteps %>%
group_by(time) %>%
drop_na() %>%   summarise(mean_total_steps = mean(StepTotal))

ggplot(data=steps_new, aes(x=time, y=mean_total_steps)) + 
geom_histogram(stat = "identity", fill='pink') + 
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) + 
labs(title="Average Total Steps vs. Time")
```

**People have the most number of steps between 6:00pm to 7:00pm**



**6.4 Minutes Asleep vs. Sedentary Minutes**
```{r}
ggplot(data=sleepactivity_merged, aes(x=TotalMinutesAsleep, y=SedentaryMinutes)) + 
geom_point(color='purple') + geom_smooth(color='pink') +
  labs(title="Minutes Asleep vs. Sedentary Minutes")
```

**There is a negative correlation between Minutes of Asleep and Sedentary Minutes. As they increase their Sedentary Minutes, they decrease the Minutes of Sleep they have.**



**6.5 Summary of Findings**

* The Average Total Steps is 7638 steps. This result is a little bit less than the recommended steps per day by CDC. CDC mentioned that taking 8,000 steps per day was associated with a 51% lower risk for all-cause mortality (or death from all causes). Taking 12,000 steps per day was associated with a 65% lower risk compared with taking 4,000 steps.
* The Sedentary Minutes is 991.2 minutes which is equivalent to 16.52 hours. While the Total Time in Bed is 458.6 minutes which is 7.64 hours.
* Comparing the activities, we can see that most of the participants are lightly active.
* The Average Minutes of Sleep is 419.5 minutes that is equivalent to 7 hours. CDC recommends 7 or more hours of sleep to people from 18 to 60 years old.
* There is a positive correlation between the Total Steps and Calories. The more steps we take, the more calories we burn.
* People are most active between 5:00pm to 7:00pm
* People have the most number of steps between 6:00pm to 7:00pm
* There is a negative correlation between Minutes of Asleep and Sedentary Minutes. As they increase their Sedentary Minutes, they decrease the Minutes of Sleep they have.

## 7. ACT PHASE

Bellabeat empowers women to reconnect with themselves, unleash their inner strengths and be what they were meant to be. 


**7.1 Recap of the Business Task**

As a junior data analyst, I am asked to analyze how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices and give insights to the creation of Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.


**7.2 Recommendations for the business**

Bellabeat is made by women for women to keep on track of their activity, sleep, stress, and other mindfulness habits. Bellabeat helps every single woman to achieve their wellness goals.

For these to be possible, it is recommended to consider the following points as part of Bellabeat app:

**1. Encourage the Bellabeat app users to take atleast 8000 steps daily. CDC found that taking 8,000 steps per day was associated with a 51% lower risk for all-cause mortality (or death from all causes).**

**2. Send a notification before 5:00pm to take a walk or do some workouts. This give the users a heads up that it is almost workout time.**

**3. Monitor the Sedentary Minutes per day and send a notification before bedtime. This will give awareness to the users about their non-active hours of that day.**

**4. Bellabeat app can consider notifying the user of the ideal time of sleep and wake up to complete 7 or more hours of sleep.**

**5. Whenever the Bellabeat app senses that the user is in Sedentary mode, the app could have a buzz to alert the user that it is time to move.**

Aside from the notifications, Bellabeat could also consider:

**6. Include workout videos that the users can follow as a form of encouragement to exercise.** 

**7. Setting of wellness goals, monthly plan and daily journal as part of motivation.**

**8. Challenges and streaks are good method to encourage consistency and discipline in increasing Active Minutes.**

**9. Award system as part of recognizing all the efforts of doing the activities, sleep and calories intake.**

**10. Connecting with friends or people nearby as support system.**

I believe these recommendations are good marketing strategy and will *boost sales* of Bellabeat product. It is a one stop activity app for women who aim to improve their overall wellness.**




**This is my first project as a junior data analyst.**

Comments and suggestions are very much welcome.

Thank you very much.
